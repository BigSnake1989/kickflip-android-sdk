# Kickflip SDK Sample for Android

**note:** The src/main/jniLibs folder will not be required of a final sample application. These native libraries are included in the sample application due to a [bug in the Android gradle plugin](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=64664) that prevents library projects from bundling pre-built native libraries.

This sample application demonstrates use of the Kickflip SDK.
